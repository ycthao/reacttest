# React Portfolio

This repo is an update version of the following two repo:

- https://github.com/ycthao/reactpf
- https://github.com/ycthao/react-portfolio

Those repo code works locally but not on github. After multiple attempts to get those links to work in github I decide to copy a basic react app from class activity and these seems to work when deployed to github.
In attempt to save myself time to focus on other assignmentd and final project as the instructor, TA and AskBCS as we had trouble figure out what is wrong with either my code or github for deploying react.

Everything in this repo works. The portfolio is very basic.
